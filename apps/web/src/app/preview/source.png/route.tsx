 * The card behind the "Read the source" hover preview.
 *
 * A route handler rather than an `opengraph-image`, because there is no
 * `/source` page for that convention to attach to — the link goes to GitHub.
 * It still comes out of `lib/og-card.tsx`, so this is the same pipeline and
 * not a second one.
 *
 * Not GitHub's own `opengraph.githubassets.com` render, which would have been
 * the lazy option: this site self-hosts its fonts and counts page views through
 * the host that already serves it, specifically so that nothing is requested
 * from anyone the reader did not choose to talk to. A hover preview is not the place to break
 * that for one PNG.
