/**
 * Page views are counted by Cloudflare Web Analytics, which Cloudflare adds to
 * each page as it serves it; there is no analytics code in this repository.
 * The beacon loads from `static.cloudflareinsights.com` -- Cloudflare's own
 * host, the company already serving every byte of this site -- so no third
 * party learns of a visit, and it sets no cookie.
 *
 * Worth being precise, because this site says "no telemetry": that claim is
 * about the product. `husk` the CLI phones nobody and nothing here changes it.
 * This counts page views of a marketing site, which is a different thing from
 * a tool reporting on its user -- but it is still measurement, and saying so
 * is cheaper than being caught omitting it.

/**
 * `metadataBase` was here before the Open Graph tags were, which is why the
 * audit found neither a canonical nor an `og:` tag on any page sampled: a base
 * URL is what `alternates` and `openGraph` are resolved *against*, not a
 * substitute for declaring them.
 *
 * These are the defaults. Both routes that render anything -- the landing page
 * and `[...slug]` -- override `title`, `description`, `canonical` and the
 * `openGraph` pair with the page's own frontmatter, which is already written
 * per page and needs no second copy.
